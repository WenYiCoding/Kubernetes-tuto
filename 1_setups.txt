1. Run local node with minikube

minikube verison
 - to check if it is installed + version

minikube start --driver=docker
 - start a cluster
 - needs container runtime (e.g. Docker-Engine)
 - also needs driver (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/), this project use docker
 - Docker Desktop can auto start cluster, check its settings

kubectl get nodes
 - list all nodes
 - only after cluster is started

minikube status
 - check node status

2. Run multiple nodes using multipass and k3s

multipass version
 - to check if it is installed + version

multipass launch --name k3s --cpus 2 --memory 4G --disk 10G
 - uses Ubuntu as image
 - creates virtual machine

multipass list
multipass ls
 - list all virtual machines

common commands
1. multipass launch --name k3s
2. multipass start k3s
3. multipass stop k3s
4. multipass shell k3s
 - log into the machine
5. multipass exec k3s --ls -l
 - directly execute command
6. multipass list
7. multipass help

as machine is linux-based, we can remote it using SSH
 - for security, always set password for each linux environment
